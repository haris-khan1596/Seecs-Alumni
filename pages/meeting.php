          FIRST NUST-SEECS ALUMNI ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETING <br>
          <span class="b_text"><strong>16th June 2007 </strong>(11:00 am - 2:00 pm)</span></strong></p>          
          <p align="justify" class="b_text">It is a matter of pride for&nbsp;your alma mater to see you all well placed in society and excelling in your respective fields and careers. We all at NUST-SEECS rejoice in your success and keep sharing your success stories with the current generation of our students, faculty and other colleagues. We indeed cherish to remain in contact with you, and benefit from your views and suggestions. Hope the recently launched NUST-SEECS-Alumni website will serve as a good forum to facilitate this interaction between our two sides. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="b_text">In yet another step to get closer Dr Arshad, have been intrigued by the idea of instituting NUST-SEECS Alumni Advisory Council (NAAC). The objective of this council is to create a body to form a sustainable linkage with the former NUST-SEECS graduates. The council would meet once a year on NUST-SEECS premises. This will provide a forum both to the participating alumni and the faculty and students at NUST-SEECS to share their experiences and benefit from each other's views and suggestions. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="b_text">The first meeting of NUST-SEECS Alumni Advisory Council (NAAC) is being planned to be held on 16th June, 2007 at NUST-SEECS&nbsp;Seminar Hall Academic Block 1. The success of this initiative largely depends on the enthusiastic participation of a good number of former NUST-SEECS students. </p>                    <ul>
