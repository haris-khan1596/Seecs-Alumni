           <p class="b_text">Keeping in mind the inability of  various alumni expatriates to attend the Homecoming, SEECS Alumni Relations  Office &amp; SEECS Alumni Association organized a lunch for them on 28th  December, 2012 at SEECS. Dr. Arshad Ali, Principal SEECS, graced the occasion  with his presence. The lunch was attended by over 35 alumni and experiences of  their time aboard were shared. A number of the alumni were pursing higher  education, Masters &amp; PhD, at prestigious universities like UC Berkeley,  University of North Carolina at Charlotte, AJOU University at South Korea &amp;  Tempere University of Technology at Finland. Many of them were working at  prominent companies like Huawei  Technologies in&nbsp; Sydney, Accenture in  London, Oracle in Bangladesh &amp; Sri Lanka, Thales Security Solutions &amp;  Services Co in Riyadh Saudi Arabia, Halliburton in Abudhabi &amp; Procera  networks in Sweden. </p>
           <p class="b_text">             Principal, Dean and Faculty at  SEECS &nbsp;also had a nice, informal chat  with the alumni. A casual re-union that revived memories and reconnected the  alumni with their university, teachers and friends. </p>
